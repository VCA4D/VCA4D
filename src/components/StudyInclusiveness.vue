      <h1>Is the value chain economic growth <strong>inclusive</strong>?</h1>
    </SectionTitle>
    <p>
      To build an image of the inclusiveness of the value chain, a VCA4D study highlights how the
      value chain organisation and governance involve the various stakeholders and how the incomes
      and employment generated are distributed among social groups. The value chain specific impact
      on vulnerable groups such as subsistence-oriented farmers, smallholders, women, youth, and
      marginalised people (landless rural workers, minority communitiesâ€¦) is closely documented.

    <QuestionTitle>How is <strong>income</strong> distributed among actors in the value chain?</QuestionTitle>
    <p>
      Income distribution is a tangible indicator of how households and businesses take advantage of
      the value chain operations. The share of Net Operating Profits across value chain actors helps
      indicate the disadvantaged actors who benefit less from the value chain activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actors that are in small numbers but receive a significant share of the value chain Net
      Operating Profit are in a stronger position of negotiation in front of those more divided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be noted that the Net Operating Profit is only related to the value chain activity
      and does not include any other revenue from any other activities.

    <QuestionTitle class="mt-8">How is <strong>employment</strong> distributed across the value chain?</QuestionTitle>
    <p>
      Employment data only relate to waged Full Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs for this specific value chain.
      The informal family workforce at the agricultural production level is not accounted for.
